Anti - Phishing using Machine Learning

This software is your normal "Network Security Filter that stops you from visiting suspicious websites with a Twist". And when we say Twist, we mean it...

Our software will never update. Unlike the other Anti-phishing softwares, our software won't rely on updated directory of marked or blacklisted websites, rather, will create its own register, every time our user experiences incoming traffic. This will make the register more user-specific and unique to each user.
